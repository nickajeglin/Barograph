Portable arduino powered barograph that displays a 48 hr chart of pressure data, pressure change per hour, and an icon to indicate pressure delta. 

# Notes

Verify the pin numbers on your arduino. I used a slightly different version that was distributed through a university eng. supply shop. 
You can use the "pro trinket li-poly backpack" on MC's that aren't an adafruit trinket, just read through the datasheet for it, and you'll figure it out pretty quick. Shoot me a message if you get stuck
